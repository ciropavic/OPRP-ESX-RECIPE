# Online Interiors

This repository is a FiveM resource adding ipl/map edits, teleport's, and blips to GTA V.

## Information
 - I basically did all the work of coordinates and ipl interior editing so you don't have to.
 - Please make sure to read the whole README for everything to work correctly.
 - Since the last update, I have removed the map edits folder. To get the map edits go here: https://github.com/cloudy-develop/online-interiors-maps
 - Online Interior Map Edits will remove some annoying obstructions around a few of the interiors.

### Note from Cloudy
- I wanted to do this because I never really saw something with Teleports and Blips and most of the working online interiors for people without ESX or VRP.
- I hope you can enjoy, I put in a lot of hours to complete this. Please expect there to be updates.
- Also, I put in a lot of work so please don’t go around saying you did all of this stuff, because you didn’t.
