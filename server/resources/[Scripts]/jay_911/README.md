# PMA-RP-911-command-script
*This is a custom made ESX script for PMA RP which allows the users to use the command /911 to send an emergency to the cops that they are in trouble!
This is my very first project and this might have a few bugs, but I am making sure there are no bugs that are parsing through after several testing on my server.*

**This project solely belongs to me and or PMA-RP and may/shall not be modified or redistrubuted to any other community.**


I have initially just added /911 to PD but I am trying to implement the same for EMS such that users can choose between sending alerts to PD or EMS. 
The way it would work in the future is that you will have to type /911 pd/ems < your emergency > so that the EMS or PD jobs get the alerts. This will be coming soon!
One more thing that I am really trying my mind and sould to make it work is have a key that will automatically set the GPS of the 911 call. This works with every other emergency in the server ecept mine so I am hoping I can make it work
I will have a list of commands that you can use with this script below


***COMMANDS you can use with the script :***

*/911 < the issue you have >* 


**Eg :** /911 Please help me, I am being shot at 

This will send the below alert to PD :


**[911] Michael Lomax | Location : Occupation Ave | Please help me, I am being shot at**
